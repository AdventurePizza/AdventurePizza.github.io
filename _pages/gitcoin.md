## What is Gitcoin?
Gitcoin is a platform that allows developers to post issues they need help solving online. A compensation amount is posted along with the issue.
Then, freelance developers can browse the list of issues on the platform to see if they are capable of fixing one.
The freelance dev will be awarded the compensation amount if he/she fixes the issue.
