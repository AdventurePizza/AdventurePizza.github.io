We are exploring the future of the web.

The web + internet is undergoing massive change; visibly, influenced heavily by immersive computing (augmented and virtual reality) and foundationally via blockchains, crypto currencies and tokens.

* * *

## Areas of exploration include:

* Next generation web browsers -- as desktop, mobile, AR and VR merge, what are the new browser + wallet + communication possibilities?

* Alt-Hardware -- Haptics, beacons, wearables, measurement devices ...

* Token potentialities -- security, utility, collectible, asset backed ... across various blockchains, simple to complex

* * *

## Current activities include:

^ Building the infrastructure to support a global, distributed team of designers, strategists and developers
^ Architecting the frameworks + processes necessary for raising $1 to $1 billion dollars from the new, emerging financial layer (blockchain ecosystem)

Previous experiments: Metaverse Navigator (raw, alpha stage)

We are building an immersive, navigable experience, with others, with data + information, decentralized.
